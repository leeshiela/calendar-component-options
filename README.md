This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, pick the branch you'd like to open to view the different calendar options.For each branch you are viewing, delete the folder `node modules` and then run `npm install` to install the correct dependencies for the branch.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Switch between branches to see the different calendar components. Be sure to delete node modules each time you switch branches and reinstall the dependencies.
